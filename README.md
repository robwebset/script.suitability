![Suitability](icon.png)

The Suitability addon allows you to get an "overview" of the content of a movie, things like the sex/violence/language content, so you can make a judgement as to the suitability for your children. (Or your grandmother!)

The addon uses the following sites to retrieve information:
* [Kids-In-Mind](http://www.kids-in-mind.com/)
* [Common Sense Media](http://www.commonsensemedia.org/)
* [The Dove Foundation](http://www.dove.org/)
* [Movie Guide](http://www.movieguide.org/)

Suitability allows you to view a summary star rating of the movie content and then drill down to view the detailed text description of the movies content. It is available via the movie context menu or launched from the Kodi Programs section (where you will be prompted for a movie name to search for) or there is also an option in settings to add it to the Confluence Movie Information Dialog.
